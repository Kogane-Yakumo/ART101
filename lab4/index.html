	<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
	<p>This lab was designed to introduce and familiarize the concept of pseudocode by having us create it for two diffrent tasks. We also got our first look at a javascript file and the pre and code tags in html.</p>
	<div>
		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p>One challenge we had was we didn't know if we had to do something special to connect the js pseudocode. We tested the code tag shown to us and it seemed to work fine but we wished there was more information on how it works.</p>
		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p>I don't really understand why this is a seperate section; what is the differance between a challenge and a problem?</p>
		<h1>Results</h1>

		<h2>Part 1: Pseudocode an everyday task</h2>
		<p>Buying Groceries:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Check the fridge and/or pantry for what is running out.</li>
			<li>Create a grocery list.</li>
			<li>Leave the house with your grocery list and a means of payment.</li>
			<li>Travel to your preferred market.</li>
			<li>Get a cart if necessary.</li>
			<li>Locate an item on your grocery list.</li>
			<li>Find a good variation of the item on your list.</li>
			<li>Repeat the previous two steps until you have every item on your list.</li>
			<li>Head to checkout and pay for your groceries.</li>
			<li>Bag your groceries.</li>
			<li>Return your cart if you got one.</li>
			<li>Return home with your groceries.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Part 2: Pseudocode a computer task</h2>
		<p>Minesweeper:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Draw a grid.</li>
			<li>Wait for the user to click a square on the grid.</li>
			<li>Generate bombs on the grid but not on the user’s selected square.</li>
			<li>Assign each square a number based on the number of bombs adjacent to it (orthoganal and diagonal).</li>
			<li>Reveal the user’s square and any adjacent blank squares (number = 0) and any squares adjacent to those blank squares.</li>
			<li>Reveal squares the user clicks on<./li>
			<li>End the game whenever a bomb is revealed or there are no unrevealed squares without bombs.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div>
		<pre><code>
			//Print the grid
			//Check for user's first input on any squares in the grid.
			  //Randomly generate bombs within the grid unselected.
			    //Assign each square a number based on the number of bombs adjacent.
			    //Reveal the user's square and any adjacent blank squares.
			    //Reveal the squares adjacent to black squares.
			//Reveal squares the user clicks on
			  //Reveal any blank squares adjacent to the clicked square and any squares adjacent to them.
			    //End the game whenever a bomb is clicked or there are no hidden squares without a bomb.
		</pre></code>
