	<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
		<p>This lab acts somewhat like an introduction to JavaScript. We experimented with the the console found in our browsers to familiarize ourselves with variable and the data types we can assign to them. We then employ what we did in the console into a JavaScript text file to be published on our webpages. <br><br><br></p>

		<h2>Challenges and Difficulties</h2>
		<p>I didn't remember the year of my family's car so took a reasonable guess also I don't have an image of it on my phone so I had to google one. The lab itself was pretty steightforward.</p>
