	<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
	<p>This lab is about the compound data types of JavaScript, more specifically arrays and objects. Arrays are lists which start at index 0 which may confuse some people. Arrays can hold data of any type even other compound data types. Objects can be assigned properties, think of these as sub-variables of a variable. We practiced creating and calling them in our console and in our documents.</p>

		<h2>Challenges and Problems</h2>
		<p>The formula in the myMainRide object seems to have exceptions in the console and I didn't really understand why for some time. I replaced the subtract year with myMainRide.year because it always had an undefined error with other names.</p>
