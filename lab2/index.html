	<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter</h1>
	<p>This lab's main idea is the get us familiarized with the basics of HTML and CSS. You were required to create, edit, test, inspect, and upload your HTML and CSS text files.</p>

	<div id="content">
		<h1 class="lab2">Hello World</h1>

		<p>I'm Ganzorig Gantushig, and I go by Ganzo. My partner's name is Levy, and ther're an art major. It's currently their third year and they've transferred to UCSC. I'm a first year proposed CS major, and have some experience in HTML, CSS, and Python. I'm a but rusty and my partner has little coding experience, but I believe that things will work out.</p>
	</div>

		<p>Niether my partner nor I were particularly good at brainstorming a paragraph to introduce ourselves. However, we were able to create and manipulate the index.html file and site.css files with relative ease. During the week that this was due, I was a bit lazy with the amount of content in our pervious iteration of lab 2. You can see it below.</p>
